#### Individual Assignment 3 - Distributed Multiplayer Game - Connect 4

An implementation of a space themed Connect 4 (now multiplayer)!

Before attempting to set up the game, ensure you have npm installed on your device.

#### How to install NPM - Node Package Manager - onto your device
1) https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm 

#### How to setup the game and install dependencies:
Assuming you have NPM installed, perform the following.
1) Clone this repository into a directory.
2) Open a terminal, navigate to the cloned repository, and run the command in "npm install"
3) Run the command "node server.js" to start the server on port 3000 of your device.
4) After you've started the server, open a browser and two tabs pointing to "http://localhost:3000/"

#### How to play!:
1) The first person to move will always move as player "Red" and the second to move will be player "Blue"
2) Each player's objective is to align 4 of their colored tiles in row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
3) After a player achieves a Connect 4 or there are no more available, either player will have the option to restart the game.

You can stop the port the game is running on by typing "Ctrl + C" into the same terminal you started the game in. Have fun!

Here are some sources I used to learn new material on CSS/HTML/Javascript to help me implement this assignment.
